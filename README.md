# WL-gesturecrane
The aim of the project is to make a gesture-controlled crane. The crane will be controlled by particular movements of the hand, and these will be detected by an accelerometer and sent to the crane using RF signals and the crane will move accordingly. It can grip and carry objects of suitable width it with it and drop it when asked to do so. There will be a glove worn on the hand containing components of accelerometer and flex sensor, microcontroller, and a wireless transmitter module. The accelerometer and flex sensor will detect the accelerations along its axes and this will be transmitted to the transmitter through a microcontroller . The other wireless module, on the crane, that is, the transceiver will receive these signals and send it to the microcontroller, which will be coded to the crane as desired. The hand gestures could also instruct the crane to grip objects and take it off with it. The gripping mechanism is controlled by a servo motor. The lifting mechanism is controlled by five high torque servo motors.
